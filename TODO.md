# General
* Figure out how to document members
* Add quadtrees to collision detection
* Simplify/split BrickBreaker::fixedUpdate into more function
* Cache PhysicsObject::getPointsGlobal
* Update util::getRandom to use c++11 random library

# Code Cleanup
* Move as many of the includes from the hpp files to the cpp files as possible
* Remove TODO's from code.
* Maybe move all the brickbreaker specific stuff into a namespace? Ball, Paddle, Wall, BrickBreaker, etc.
